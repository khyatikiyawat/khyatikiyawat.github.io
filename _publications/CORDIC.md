excerpt: 'Hyperbolic trigonometric functions are widely used in several engineering and scientific applications, including digital signal processing (DSP), communication systems, and many others. In this article, we propose a scaling-free hyperbolic coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm and its architecture based on a novel power-of-2 coefficient low-complexity Taylor series approximation to implement sinh and cosh functions. CORDIC architectures are generally slow due to their high latency of computation. The proposed architecture reduces the latency and achieves the desired precision with only four iterations where an optimized angle set comprised of six CORDIC microrotations are mapped into a four-stage folded-pipeline structure leveraging mutually exclusive behavior of two pairs of microrotations. The proposed design is implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) Xilinx Zedboard using 65.38% less registers with ~63.63% less latency and 48.97% less power consumption compared with the best of the existing designs. The proposed design is synthesized by Synopsys Design Compiler and place and route (PnR) tool using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 65-nm CMOS process. It consumes ~76.31% less area, 68.75% less computational delay, and 68.92% less power consumption compared with the best of the existing designs. Moreover, the proposed architecture involves 46.89% less energy per output (EPO) than the best of the existing designs. The error–energy performance (EEP) and the error–area performance (EAP) of the proposed design are, respectively, ~1.25 times and ~2.8 times better than that of the best of the existing designs. Besides, the proposed architecture is also implemented and verified on a silicon chip in the TSMC 180-nm CMOS process for the validation of the algorithm and architecture.'
